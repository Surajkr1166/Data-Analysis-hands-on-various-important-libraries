📘 Python Libraries for Data Analysis & Visualization
This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to Python libraries used in data analysis and data visualization. It covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations to build a strong foundation.

🧮 NumPy
NumPy is a core Python library used for numerical computations and array-based operations.

Topics Covered:

In-built functions in NumPy

Array indexing and slicing

Operations on NumPy arrays

🐼 Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library used for data manipulation and analysis with Series and DataFrames.

Topics Covered:

Series

DataFrame

Indexing

Reading files (CSV, Excel, etc.)

In-built DataFrame functions

File conversion

Slicing in DataFrame

loc VS iloc

Boolean filtering

Data cleaning techniques

GroupBy operations

Concatenation of DataFrames

Joins and merge operations

Pivot tables

Aggregation functions

Date range functions

to_datetime() function

📊 Matplotlib
Matplotlib is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Topics Covered:

Line plot

Scatter plot

Histogram

Pie chart

Donut pie chart

Subplots

Figure object

🎨 Seaborn
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and is used for statistical data visualization.
